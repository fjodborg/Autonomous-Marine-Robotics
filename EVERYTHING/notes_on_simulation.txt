% Simulation 01 was done with source:
% [10, 22, -1]
% And paths:
% MD = missionDesigner(northg=20.0, eastg=50.0, ng=24, northl=6, eastl=6.0, nl=10, northg0=0.0, eastg0=0.0)

% 20 by 50 global path, 24 points in it, start at [0,0]
% 6 by 6 local path, 10 points in it.
% Circle of acceptance: 0.3
% Measurement threshold: 0.1

% Simulation 02 was a repeat with 
% Measurement threshold: 0.01
